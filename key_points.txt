Dale Carnegie got it right — “If you want to be interesting, be interested.

Always try to have small talks with people you meet everyday, or randomly, because most people won't open up to you about the big things in their lives if you don't express interest in their little day-to-day happenings.

"People may forget what you say, but they will never forget how you made them feel."
