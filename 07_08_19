Why do we lose signals inside a lift or elevator car?

Explanation:

To a very good approximation, the electric field inside a conductor is zero when there is no net transport of charge across the conductor. Since an electromagnetic field is dependent on varying electric fields, there is an inherent block against electromagnetic waves penetrating very far into closed metal surfaces under most circumstances.
